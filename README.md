# MATLAB Projects Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **MATLAB Projects Repository**! This repository contains small independent projects developed in MATLAB across various fields of communication and control systems. The projects aim to illustrate fundamental concepts and techniques in:

- **Analog Communication**
- **Digital Communication**
- **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**
- **Control Systems**

Each project is designed to be self-contained, providing the necessary code, documentation, and resources to facilitate learning and experimentation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into four main categories, each containing multiple projects:
```
MATLAB-Projects/ │ ├── Analog-Communication/ ├── Digital-Communication/ ├── DSP/ └── Control/
```

## Features

- **Analog Communication**: Explore techniques such as Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM).
- **Digital Communication**: Implement digital modulation schemes, error detection methods, and more.
- **DSP**: Analyze and manipulate signals using various digital signal processing techniques.
- **Control Systems**: Simulate and design control systems to understand system dynamics and stability.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB** (version R2020b or later recommended)
- Any specific toolboxes required for certain projects (please refer to individual project READMEs for details).

## Usage

To use the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedhanyanwar/MATLAB-Projects.git
2. **Navigate to the desired project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MATLAB-Projects/Analog-Communication/Project1  # Adjust the path as needed
3. **Open MATLAB and run the script**:
   ```matlab
   run('code.m')
4. **Review the README in each project folder for specific instructions and details**.
